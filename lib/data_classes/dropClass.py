        Store and process sensor data for the selected drop region.

        This method updates the units of acceleration and time, converts time units to seconds, 
        and extracts relevant segments of acceleration data for the selected drop. It also calculates 
        and stores indices for the release, start, and end of the impulse. If the release point cannot 
        be found, it raises an error.

        Parameters
        ----------

        accel : numpy.ndarray
            Array of acceleration values.
        time : numpy.ndarray
            Array of time values.
        input_units : dict, optional
            Dictionary specifying the units for acceleration and time. Default is {"accel": "g", "Time": "min"}.
            - "accel": Unit of acceleration, e.g., "g" (gravity).
            - "Time": Unit of time, e.g., "min" (minutes).

        Notes
        -----

        - The method performs the following steps:
            1. Updates the units of acceleration and time.
            2. Converts the time units to seconds.
            3. Computes the indices for the start and end of the impulse.
            4. Attempts to find the release index; raises an error if not found.
            5. Stores the indices and calculated data for further processing.
        - The time units are converted to seconds regardless of the input unit.
        - If the release index cannot be found due to proximity to the start of the file, 
        an error is caught and re-raised after processing the available indices.

        Raises
        ------
