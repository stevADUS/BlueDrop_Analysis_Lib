    inputs:

    This function computes the dynamic net bearing resistance (`qNet_dyn`) at a specified velocity (`wanted_velocity`) 
    and depth, given various soil and probe parameters. It first determines the dry net bearing resistance (`qNet_dry`) 
    using either a specified relative density or a guessed value and then computes the dynamic bearing resistance for the desired velocity.

    Parameters

    ----------
    qNet_d_guess : float
        An initial guess for the dry net bearing resistance. A reasonable range is between 1000 and 10000 kPa.
    qNet_dyn : float
        The measured dynamic net bearing resistance.
    depth : float
        Depth of the current measurement below the sediment interface, typically in meters.
    relative_density : float
        Relative density of the soil, typically expressed as a percentage. Used when `calc_relative_density` is True.
    measured_velocity : float
        Velocity of the portable free fall penetrometer (PFFP) at the measurement location, typically in m/s.
    coeff_consolidation : float
        Coefficient of consolidation of the soil, typically in m²/s.
    V_50 : float, optional
        Dimensionless velocity corresponding to a 50% reduction in the undrained shear strength. Default is 1.
    Q : float, optional
        Crushing coefficient or a parameter related to the soil’s response to penetration. Default is 10.
    wanted_velocity : float, optional
        Desired velocity at which the dynamic net bearing resistance is calculated. Default is 0.02 m/s.
    probe_diameter : float, optional
        Diameter of the probe used in the measurement, typically in meters. Default is 1 m.
    phi_cv : float, optional
        Critical state friction angle, typically in degrees. Default is 32°.
    Nkt : float, optional
        Cone factor, used to calculate the undrained shear strength from the net bearing resistance. Default is 12.
    calc_relative_density : bool, optional
        If True, the function will calculate the dry net bearing resistance based on the relative density. 
        If False, a dry net bearing resistance is calculated using a guessed value. Default is False.

    Returns

    -------
    float
        Dynamic net bearing resistance (`wanted_qNet_dyn`) at the specified velocity (`wanted_velocity`).

    Notes

    -----
    The function proceeds through the following steps:
    1. Calculate the dimensionless velocity (`current_V`) at the measured velocity.
    2. Determine the dry net bearing resistance (`qNet_dry`) based on either a guessed value or calculated relative density.
    3. Calculate the dynamic net bearing resistance (`wanted_qNet_dyn`) at the desired velocity.

    This function relies on several helper functions, including:
    - `calc_dimensionless_velocity`: Calculates the dimensionless velocity.
    - `find_qNet_dry`: Finds the dry net bearing resistance.
    - `calc_white_failure_mean_eff_stress`: Calculates the mean effective stress at failure.
    - `calc_mohr_coulomb_su`: Calculates the undrained shear strength using the Mohr-Coulomb criterion.
    - `calc_qNet_undrained`: Calculates the net bearing resistance under undrained conditions.
    - `calc_white_qNet_dyn`: Calculates the dynamic net bearing resistance using the White method.

    If debugging (`DEBUG`) is enabled, the function prints intermediate results, such as the calculated dimensionless velocities, relative density, and dry bearing resistance.
